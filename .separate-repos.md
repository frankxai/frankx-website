# Repository Separation Strategy

## Current State
- All content mixed in single public repo
- Business strategy exposed publicly
- Not optimal for brand or security

## Target Structure

### 1. Private Repo: `frankx-strategy`
**Purpose**: Internal business intelligence
**Contents**:
- Brand foundation docs (01-Brand-Foundation/)  
- Product suite strategy (03-Product-Suite/)
- Business plan & financials (05-Business-Plan/)
- Marketing strategy (06-Marketing-Strategy/) 
- Internal workflows & agent configs
- Customer research & competitive analysis

### 2. Public Repo: `frankx-website` (current)
**Purpose**: Customer-facing website & community
**Contents**:
- Next.js website code
- Blog content & resources
- Community showcase
- Open source tools
- Public documentation

## Implementation Plan
1. Create private repo with GitHub CLI
2. Move sensitive docs to private repo
3. Clean public repo of internal strategy
4. Setup automated deployment from public repo
5. Link repositories for content sync where appropriate

## Benefits
- Protects business strategy
- Clean public brand presence  
- Professional separation
- Better for Oracle compliance
